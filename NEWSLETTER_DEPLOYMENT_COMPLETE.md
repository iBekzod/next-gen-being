## 🚀 Deployment to Production

### 1. Deploy Files to Server

```bash
# On your production server
cd /var/www/nextgenbeing

# Pull latest code
git add .
git commit -m "Add complete newsletter system with email automation"
git push origin main

# On server, pull changes
git pull origin main
```

### 2. Run Migrations

```bash
# On production server
php artisan migrate --force
```

### 3. Clear Caches

```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan cache:clear
```

### 4. Set Up Cron Job (One-Time Setup)

```bash
# On production server
crontab -e

# Add this line if not already present:
* * * * * cd /var/www/nextgenbeing && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

### 5. Configure Production Mail (IMPORTANT!)

Your `.env` currently uses Mailhog (development only). Update for production:

#### Option A: AWS SES (Recommended - Cheapest)
```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your_ses_smtp_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_ses_smtp_password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@nextgenbeing.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Next Gen Being"
```

#### Option B: SendGrid
```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=apikey
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_sendgrid_api_key
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@nextgenbeing.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Next Gen Being"
```

#### Option C: Mailgun
```env
MAIL_MAILER=mailgun
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=mg.nextgenbeing.com
MAILGUN_SECRET=your_mailgun_secret
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@nextgenbeing.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Next Gen Being"
```

## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics

### View Subscriber Count

```sql
-- Total active subscribers
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM newsletter_subscriptions WHERE is_active = 1 AND verified_at IS NOT NULL;

-- Subscribers by frequency
SELECT frequency, COUNT(*) as count
FROM newsletter_subscriptions
WHERE is_active = 1 AND verified_at IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY frequency;
```

### Campaign Analytics

```sql
-- Campaign performance
SELECT
    id,
    subject,
    recipients_count,
    opened_count,
    clicked_count,
    ROUND((opened_count * 100.0 / recipients_count), 2) as open_rate,
    ROUND((clicked_count * 100.0 / recipients_count), 2) as click_rate,
    sent_at
FROM newsletter_campaigns
WHERE status = 'sent'
ORDER BY sent_at DESC;
```

### Recent Subscribers

```sql
SELECT email, frequency, created_at, verified_at
FROM newsletter_subscriptions
WHERE is_active = 1
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
