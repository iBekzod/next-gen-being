2. Highlight a keyword or phrase
3. Click the link button (chain icon) in the editor toolbar

- 10% → Your homepage or pricing page

**Anchor Text (Link Label):**
- USE: Descriptive keywords (`How to learn prompt engineering`)

**Quantity:**
- Target: 5-10 links per 2,000 words of content
- Formula: 1 link per 200-300 words
- Don't cluster them - spread throughout the post

**Location:**

- Natural placement only

**Example:**
- Before: "You should learn about prompt engineering."
